 * History is per-page: each page maintains its own independent
 * undo stack, and switching pages does NOT clear it. Switching
 * back to a page restores its history exactly where the user left
 * off. This spec confirms both halves of that contract.
 *
 * (This used to be a "clears-on-page-switch" spec — the old
 * zundo-based stack was global and got wiped on every page load.
 * The visual-history panel replaced that with per-page buckets
 * keyed by tsxPath.)
