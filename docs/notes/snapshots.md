# Project snapshots

Persistent point-in-time copies of a project's page + component files,
stored inside the project so they travel with it. They're the safety net
for the overwrite bug: even when Scamp clobbers externally-written CSS,
the user can restore the last good state. The history **panel** shows
snapshots; **Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z** in-session undo is a separate system
(historySlice) and is unaffected.

## Storage layout

```
<project>/.scamp/
  snapshots.json            ← index: [{ id, timestamp, trigger, label, pageCount }]
  snapshots/<id>/           ← full file copies, mirroring the project tree
    app/page.tsx
    app/page.module.css
    app/<page>/page.*
    components/<Name>/<Name>.*
```

- `.scamp/` is already in the scaffolded `.gitignore` and already ignored
  by chokidar (`watcher.ts`), so snapshot writes never fire `file:changed`.
- The snapshot **folder is named by `id`** (`snap_<12 hex>`) — a stable
  1:1 mapping with the index entry (the PRD's timestamp-named folders were
  illustrative).
- Only `.tsx` + `.module.css` page/component files are captured —
  `theme.css` / `agent.md` / `next.config.ts` / `package.json` are not.
- Enumeration is a **direct byte walk** (not `parseCode`), so a malformed
  file an agent just wrote is captured faithfully.
- Limit **50** per project; the oldest is pruned (folder + index entry)
  when a new one would exceed it. (Cloud backup later lifts this.)

## Triggers

| Trigger | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `session_open` | `project.ts openProject` | Fire-and-forget before the canvas loads + before open-time scaffolding writes — captures what changed between sessions. The most important trigger. |
| `agent_edit` | `watcher.ts emitChange` | When `consumed === null` (no pending-write entry ⇒ external). 5-s collapse coalesces an agent's burst. Captures detection-time disk (the edit has already landed; the prior snapshot is the true pre-edit state). |
| `session_close` | `index.ts before-quit` + `App.tsx onClose` | From disk on app-quit; renderer flush + `snapshot:create` on in-app project close. |
| `manual` | History panel "Save snapshot" | User-typed name or "Manual snapshot". |
| `auto_save` | `useSnapshotAutoSave` | ≤ once per 2 min of canvas activity; gated by the `snapshotAutoSave` config flag (default on). Kept coarse on purpose — fine per-edit granularity comes from the undo entries the panel interleaves (see "Panel timeline"), not from more disk writes. |
| `before_restore` | inside `restoreSnapshot` | Snapshots the current state so a restore is itself undoable. |

All snapshot creation is **silent-fail** — `createSnapshot` never throws,
so a failed snapshot can't block opening/closing a project.

## Panel timeline (snapshots + undo)

The History panel renders a single newest-first timeline that interleaves
two sources, built by the pure `mergeHistoryTimeline` in
`store/snapshotDisplay.ts`:

- **Snapshot rows** — the durable on-disk snapshots above. Clicking one
  opens the restore confirm and replaces files from disk (whole project).
- **Undo rows** — the active page's in-memory undo entries
  (`historySlice`), shown indented/lighter between the snapshots. Clicking
  one calls `jumpToHistory` — an instant in-session jump on the current
  page, no disk write, no confirm. The cursor entry is `current`
  (non-clickable); redoable entries past it are `future` (greyed).

This gives per-edit granularity between the coarser 2-min snapshots
without writing every edit to disk. Two intentional limits: undo rows are
**per-page** (only the page you're viewing) and **session-only** (the
in-memory stack is lost on close, so past sessions show only snapshots).
Clicks are suppressed while a canvas drag is in flight (`transactionDepth`).

## Preview before restore

Clicking a snapshot row doesn't restore immediately — it enters a
**read-only preview**. `previewSnapshot` (snapshotsSlice) reads the active
page's files from the snapshot via `snapshot:read-page` (a non-mutating
read; never touches disk), parses them, and calls
`enterSnapshotPreview` (canvas store) which **stashes** the live document
state and swaps the snapshot's onto the canvas. A banner over the canvas
(`CanvasArea`) offers **Restore** / **Exit**.

While `snapshotPreview` is set:
- The canvas is non-editable. Guards bail in the pointer interactions
  (draw / move / resize), the double-click-to-edit-text entry, the
  keyboard-shortcut handler (incl. undo/redo), and the store mutators
  (`patchElement`, the reset actions, `setElementText`, `setPropOverride`),
  plus the toolbar. Zoom / terminal / preview-window shortcuts stay live.
- The History panel's **"Now"** row becomes an Exit button (alongside the
  banner's Exit), and its undo rows + "Save snapshot" are inert.
- The sync bridge **suppresses all writes** (and the exit transition), so
  preview content — and any edit that slips a guard — can never reach
  disk. Auto-save is likewise skipped.
- **Exit** (`exitSnapshotPreview`) restores the stash from memory — no disk
  round-trip. **Restore** runs the flow below, then `clearSnapshotPreview`
  drops the stash (the disk re-read already replaced the canvas content).

The lock is keyed only on `snapshotPreview` being non-null, so anything
that **authoritatively replaces the canvas content while a preview is up
must also clear it** — otherwise the read-only lock leaks onto content the
user never previewed (a stuck "can't delete / can't edit" state). The
content-replacing actions in the document slice all set
`snapshotPreview: null`: `loadPage` / `loadComponent` (navigating to a
different target), `reloadElements` (an external/agent edit reloads the
active file), and `resetForNewPage`. The stash is intentionally discarded
in these paths — the new content is now authoritative, so there's nothing
to restore back to. Exit/Restore from the banner remain the only paths
that go *back* to the stashed pre-preview state.

## Restore flow

1. Banner Restore → `restorePreview` → `snapshot:restore` (renderer awaits).
2. Main: `before_restore` snapshot, then copy the snapshot's files back.
   Each copied file is registered as a **suppressed pending-write** so the
   watcher treats the burst as Scamp's own writes — no `agent_edit`
   snapshot, no per-file reload.
3. Main broadcasts `ProjectPagesChanged`; `App.tsx` re-reads the whole
   project from disk (its content-diffing merge picks up the restored
   pages) and the active page reloads through the normal load path.
4. The renderer clears the in-session undo stack (`clearAllHistory`) —
   you can't Cmd+Z back through a restore.

Restore is an **overlay** copy: files added after the snapshot are left in
place (not deleted).

## Cloud-backup foundation

`snapshots.json` + the per-snapshot folders map directly to the planned
cloud system: the index syncs to the project's Neon record, the folders to
R2, the local 50-limit becomes unlimited cloud history, and the local
`.scamp/` becomes a most-recent-50 cache. The panel UI is unchanged; cloud
snapshots appear in the same list.
