# Agent coexistence

Scamp's bidirectional sync (canvas ↔ files on disk) has a hard problem: when an external agent edits the same file at the same time, who wins? This note captures the design.

The plan that drove the implementation lives at `/docs/agent-coexistence-plan.md` — this note is the "what shipped" version.

## The seven save-status states

`saveStatusSlice` drives the indicator pill in the toolbar. Each state has a defined trigger, visual treatment, and (where applicable) recovery action.

| State | Trigger | Indicator | Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|
| `saved` | Canvas matches disk. | "Saved" (calm green check). | n/a |
| `unsaved` | Canvas edit landed; debounced write pending. | "Unsaved" (warning yellow dot). | Wait — auto-saves in 200ms. |
| `saving` | Write IPC in flight. | "Saving…" (spinner). | n/a |
| `error` | Write failed with a generic IPC error. | "Save failed" (red, **Retry** button). | Click Retry; the failed attempt re-dispatches. |
| `paused` | External edit detected (Phase 1.1) or quiet window open (Phase 3.2). Canvas edits queue, no IPC dispatched. | "Paused" (blue pause icon, clickable). | Click to expand: **Resume now** force-clears the window and reconciles. Otherwise auto-resumes when the window expires. |
| `diverged` | Quiet window expired, canvas state ≠ disk state. | "Diverged" (amber, clickable). | Click to expand: **Save canvas** force-overwrites disk; **Discard canvas** reloads from disk. |
| `reloaded-from-disk` | A canvas-side write was main-process-rejected because disk drifted. Canvas already reloaded; user's in-flight edit was discarded. | "Reloaded" (neutral, clickable, **no Retry**). | Click to expand: read what happened. Cleared on the next successful save cycle. |

The `error` and `reloaded-from-disk` states are both terminal — they persist through canvas edits until a fresh save cycle (or user-driven discard) clears them. Other transitions are governed by `markUnsaved`'s guard list in `saveStatusSlice.ts`.

## The two pause signals

The sync engine pauses (refuses to dispatch canvas-side writes) when EITHER of two conditions is true:

### 1. External edit pending (Phase 1.1)

Tracked in `src/renderer/src/lib/externalEditTracker.ts`. A per-path set of files currently being reloaded by `onFileChanged`. Set at the top of the chokidar handler (after the late-echo guard), cleared in its `finally` block. Lives just long enough to protect against the synchronous race where a canvas edit fires `writeIfDirty` while the renderer is mid-reload.

### 2. Quiet window (Phase 3.2)

Tracked in `src/renderer/src/lib/quietWindow.ts`. Set on every chokidar event for a project file; rolls forward 2.5s on each subsequent event. Catches agent write bursts where 3-5 writes to the same file land in close succession — Scamp stays paused until the burst fully settles plus a grace window.

The two signals overlap but cover different timing: the tracker is sub-millisecond protection against the synchronous race; the quiet window is multi-second protection against intentional bursts.

Phase 4 (terminal-busy heuristic) is planned but not yet shipped. It will add a third signal — `agent-terminal` — fired when Scamp's integrated terminal has a non-shell foreground process. Until then, agents running in Scamp's terminal only get protection via the chokidar signals above (which is sufficient — every file write triggers them).

## What's exempt

These files don't pause the sync engine and aren't covered by the quiet window:

- **`theme.css`** — managed by Scamp's Fonts and Theme panels but never written by the canvas regen pipeline. Agents can edit `theme.css` freely while the canvas is active.
- **`agent.md` / `CLAUDE.md`** — fully managed by Scamp; rewritten on every project open. Don't edit by hand.
- **`scamp.config.json`** — project settings; not part of the canvas pipeline.

Everything else under the project root that matches `*.tsx` or `*.module.css` is on the protected list.

## Save canvas vs Discard canvas

When the quiet window expires with the canvas diverging from disk, the user picks:

- **Save canvas** — force-overwrite disk with the canvas's current state. No conflict check, no expected-content guard. This is "I know there's an external edit; I want mine to win." The user already saw the indicator transition through `paused`, so this isn't accidental.
- **Discard canvas** — re-parse disk content and reload the canvas. In-memory canvas changes since the pause started are lost.

The popover's `Save canvas` uses the bridge's `saveDivergedCanvasImpl`; `Discard canvas` uses `discardDivergedCanvasImpl`. Both go through normal save-status transitions so the toast / indicator behave the same as any other write.

## Toast for aborted writes

A separate `toast` field on `saveStatusSlice` surfaces a transient banner — anchored below the toolbar — when Scamp has to abort a canvas write because an external edit is in progress. Auto-dismisses after 4s, throttled to one toast per 4s (so a burst of aborts doesn't spam).

This is the dedicated "you did something but it didn't land" signal. The pill going to `paused` is the persistent state; the toast is the moment-of-event surface.

## Per-OS notes

- **Linux + macOS**: full coverage (Phases 1-3 shipped, Phase 4 detection planned).
- **Windows**: Phase 4's `node-pty` foreground-process introspection is platform-specific. ConPTY has limited APIs; the terminal-busy heuristic will be deferred or implemented differently. Phases 1-3 work identically.

## How to test locally

Quick smoke test that the pause works:

1. Open any project in Scamp.
2. Make a canvas edit (draw a rect, drag an element).
3. Without releasing focus from Scamp, run from another terminal: `echo "/* hi */" >> app/page.module.css` (or whatever the active page's CSS path is).
4. Observe: the indicator should flip to `Paused` (blue pause icon) within ~2 seconds. A toast should appear: "Your canvas change wasn't saved — home was just edited externally."
5. Wait 3 seconds without touching anything. The indicator should auto-resume — either back to `Saved` (if canvas matched disk after the reload) or to `Diverged` (if canvas had pending changes).
6. If diverged, click the pill, then pick Save canvas or Discard canvas.

## Where the dangling refs went

Earlier code commented `see docs/known-issues.md — "Concurrent-write race"` and `see docs/known-issues.md — "late-chokidar echo race"`. That doc never existed (the references slipped in during an earlier session). The content lives here now:

- "Concurrent-write race" → this note's [What's exempt](#whats-exempt) section + Phase 1.1 protection.
- "late-chokidar echo race" → the byte-equality guard in `syncBridge.ts onFileChanged` that ignores chokidar events whose payload byte-matches our own last write.

Specific affected callsites (`src/main/ipc/fileConflict.ts:14`, `src/renderer/src/syncBridge.ts:471, 1013`, `src/shared/types.ts:284`) should be updated to point here on the next pass through those files.
