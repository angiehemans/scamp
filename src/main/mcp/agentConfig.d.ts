 * --scope project` turned out to just write a plain `.mcp.json`, so we write
 * it ourselves, and the same trick generalises to the other agents.
 *
 * ⚠️ This is the only code in the MCP feature that writes OUTSIDE `.scamp/`.
 * Every write merges into whatever the user already had — clobbering someone's

 * would have registered a streamable-HTTP server as SSE and failed at
 * connect time, silently, only for Gemini users.
 *
 * Deliberately absent, pending verification:
 *   - VS Code (`.vscode/mcp.json`, `servers` key) — the docs I could reach
 *     describe the extension-provider API, which uses `uri`, not the user
 *     `mcp.json` format. Guessing produces a file that is silently ignored.
 *     `.vscode/mcp.json` also permits comments, which our merge cannot
 *     preserve — another reason to hold.
 *   - Codex (`~/.codex/config.toml`) — TOML, and project-level support is
 *     unconfirmed. A TOML *writer* that preserves a user's existing file is
 *     a different job from a JSON merge.
 * Both are additive later; the copy button (Phase 6) covers them meanwhile.
