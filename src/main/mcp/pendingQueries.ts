 * The pull-through half of the MCP server: main asks the renderer for live
 * canvas state and waits for a correlated reply.
 *
 * A cached snapshot in main would be simpler, but it would answer an agent's
 * "what is selected" with whatever the last debounce captured — wrong right
 * after the user clicks, which is exactly when they ask. A visible timeout
 * beats a silently stale answer.
 *
 * Electron-free on purpose: `send` is injected, so the whole correlation and
 * timeout story is testable without a BrowserWindow.
