/**
 * The original of an imported page, kept where an agent can read it.
 *
 * An import is a lossy translation into a model far more constrained
 * than a browser, and the report says what was changed but not what the
 * page originally said. Keeping the source next to the result turns
 * "why is this element like this?" from a guess into a lookup — the
 * agent can read the rule that produced a layout instead of inferring
 * one from the output.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT in the project. This is scratch: a copy of somebody
 * else's page, useful while the import is being tidied up and noise
 * afterwards. It lives in the OS temp directory and goes when the
 * project closes, so nothing about it ever reaches a commit.
 * see docs/notes/import-source-store.md
