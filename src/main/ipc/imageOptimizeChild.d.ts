/**
 * Image conversion, in a child process.
 *
 * sharp is built on libvips, a GObject library, and Chromium on Linux
 * uses GLib too — run in Electron's MAIN process the two corrupt each
 * other's GObject state and take the app down after a handful of
 * encodes. In a separate process libvips is the only thing touching
 * GObject and it's stable: 25 sequential conversions of a 96MP photo
 * with no failure. (Electron still prints GLib warnings at startup here;
 * they're noise, not a symptom.)
 *
 * Forked with ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE, so this file runs as plain Node.
 * `sharp` is required by absolute path, handed over by the parent, because
 * this file is resolved from the app bundle rather than from a place
 * where bare-specifier resolution would find node_modules.
 * see docs/plans/image-import-speed-plan.md
