/**
 * Redeeming the callback code for a session token.
 *
 * `POST /api/desktop/token { code, codeVerifier }` → `{ token, user }`.
 * This is the only place the verifier is used, and the only place it
 * leaves memory — over TLS to the backend, never to the browser.
 *
 * The token that comes back is an opaque Better Auth session token, not a
 * JWT: 30 days, refreshed on use, no refresh token. So there is no
 * lifecycle to manage here — a later `401` means sign in again, not
 * refresh. see docs/plans/electron-sign-in-plan.md
 *
 * `fetch` is injected so the failure paths can be tested without a
 * network or a running backend.
