/**
 * The loopback listener the browser redirects back to.

 * Chosen over the `scamp://` scheme as the primary mechanism: no OS
 * protocol registration, one entry point instead of three, and no other
 * application can claim it — we hold the socket. See decision 5 in
 * docs/plans/electron-sign-in-plan.md.
 *
 * The port is fixed because the backend's redirect allowlist is exact
 * match with no wildcard, so a random port would be refused. That makes
 * "port already in use" a real outcome the caller has to handle rather
 * than an edge case, and it is why `start` reports it distinctly: it is
 * the signal to fall back to the custom scheme.
