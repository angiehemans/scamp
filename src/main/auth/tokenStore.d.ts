/**
 * Where the desktop session token lives.

 * The token is an opaque Better Auth session token — a bearer credential
 * with 30 days of sliding life — so it is treated as a secret at rest and
 * never written in the clear.
 *
 * `safeStorage` is injected rather than imported so this module can be
 * tested without Electron, and so the no-encryption path can be exercised
 * directly. That path is the point of the module: on a Linux box with no
 * keyring, `encryptString` can still "succeed" while producing something
 * recoverable, which is exactly the silent plaintext write the story
 * forbids.
