/**
 * The pure half of desktop sign-in: PKCE, the sign-in URL, and reading the
 * callback. No network, no Electron, no disk — so the security properties
 * can be tested directly.
 *
 * The shape is PKCE (RFC 7636). The callback carries a short-lived CODE,
 * never a token, and the code is only redeemable with a verifier that
 * never leaves this process. That matters because a custom scheme is
 * claimable by any application on the machine — an interceptor that reads
 * the callback URL gets something it cannot spend.
 *
 * `state` is generated and checked too, but it is not the defence. It
 * proves a callback belongs to a request we made; it does not prove only
 * we can use it.
 *
 * see docs/plans/electron-sign-in-plan.md
