 *
 * It exists because until cloud sync ships the app talks to the API at
 * sign-in and then essentially never again — so someone using Scamp every
 * day for a month registered as a single active day. Authenticated calls
 * are recorded as activity now, but the app barely makes any; the
 * heartbeat measures the thing that is actually meant, which is that the
 * app was open.
 *
 * Two rules shape everything here:
 *
 * A signed-out app must cost nothing. No token, no request — the same
 * rule that keeps `getStatus` off the network on launch.
 *
 * And activity reporting must never be the reason something breaks. Every
 * failure is swallowed; the one thing a response can do is a 401, which
 * means the session is genuinely gone and the UI would otherwise keep
 * claiming the user is signed in.
 *
 * see docs/notes/desktop-heartbeat.md
