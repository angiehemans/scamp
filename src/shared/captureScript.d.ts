 * The capture script — the one piece that has to run inside the page.

 * target document, so it MUST be self-contained: no imports, no
 * closures over module scope, no TypeScript that doesn't survive being
 * read back as plain JS. Everything it needs arrives as its argument,
 * which is why the policy is data rather than a set of imports — a
 * `Set` doesn't survive `JSON.stringify`, so the policy carries arrays
 * and the function rebuilds them.
 *
 * Keeping it a real exported function rather than a template string
 * means it typechecks and the fixture generator can call it directly
 * through Playwright's `page.evaluate`.
 * see docs/plans/website-import-plan.md
