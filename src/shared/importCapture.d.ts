/**
 * The contract between the capture script and the reducer.
 *
 * Capture runs inside the page (it needs a live DOM and
 * `getComputedStyle`); the reducer is pure and runs in the renderer.
 * This module is the seam: a serializable payload, plus the policy that
 * decides which properties are worth carrying across it.
 *
 * The split matters because of size. A computed style holds 340+
 * properties per element; carrying all of them for a 2000-node page
 * would be tens of megabytes over IPC and would bury every element in
 * junk. Capture therefore filters, and the payload holds only what an
 * author plausibly set.
 *
 * ## What capture does NOT do, and why
 *
 * The plan said to diff each element against a bare probe of the same
 * tag rendered in the source document. That is wrong, and writing it
 * showed why: it answers "what did this page's author set beyond their
 * own reset", when the question is **"what must a Scamp module declare
 * to make this element look like it does here"**. A page with no reset
 * gets the UA's `<p>` margin for free; diff it away against a probe and
 * the import loses its paragraph spacing, because Scamp's own reset
 * zeroes it.
 *
 * So the source document's baseline is never consulted. Capture drops
 * only values that are universally "nothing set" (`INITIAL_VALUES`) and
 * inherited values matching the parent — inheritance behaves the same
 * in both documents, so that one IS safe. The real diff, against
 * Scamp's own baseline, happens in the reducer where `makeBaseline`
 * already knows the answer and a test can check it.
 * see docs/plans/website-import-plan.md
