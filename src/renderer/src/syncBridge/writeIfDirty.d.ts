 * switch flush, and the beforeunload flush, all of which need to write a
 * SPECIFIC snapshot rather than whatever the store currently holds.
 *
 * `customMediaBlocks` and `pageKeyframesBlocks` are passed in (not read
 * from the store) because the page-switch flush fires AFTER `loadPage(B)`
 * has swapped the store's per-page CSS into B's values.

 * propagates through to `onWriteConflict` so a conflict adopts disk
 * without flashing the "Reloaded" indicator.
