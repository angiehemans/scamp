/**
 * Keeping animated elements from driving the canvas extent.
 *
 * The content extent decides the fit zoom and the overflow indicator. It is
 * measured from bounding boxes, and a bounding box includes the element's
 * current transform — so an element with a running animation reports a
 * different extent depending on when you happen to look at it.
 *
 * A real project made this obvious: a hero glow with
 * `animation: glow-drift 18s infinite` translating 60px and scaling 1.08.
 * Every edit re-measured, caught the glow somewhere new, and the canvas
 * flipped between two zoom levels — 802/1440 = 55.7% at rest, 802/1474 =
 * 54.4% mid-drift — with the overflow warning appearing and vanishing
 * along with it.
 *
 * The fix is not to skip these elements: one parked off the right edge is
 * genuinely overflowing and the user needs to see that. It is to measure
 * their LAYOUT box instead — `offsetLeft`/`offsetWidth`, which ignore
 * transforms entirely and so report where the element rests rather than
 * where this frame of the animation put it.
 *
 * see docs/notes/canvas-extent-oscillation.md

/**
 * A predicate for "this element is animating, or sits inside something

 * Descendants count because a transform on an ancestor moves them too —
 * measuring a static child of a drifting parent reads the drift.
