 * Canvas-view chrome that marks the viewport boundary when content

 * (which may be larger than the canvas when clip is off, to reserve the
 * spilling content) — so the boundary lines are positioned at the canvas
 * bounds (`boundaryWidth`/`boundaryHeight` × scale), NOT the shell edges.
 * Purely informational — pointer-events are disabled, and it's excluded
 * from exports.
 *
 * - Horizontal overflow (clip off): amber dashed line at the right edge +
 *   a "+ Npx overflow" label.
 * - Vertical overflow (clip off, fixed height): amber dashed line at the
 *   bottom edge + label.
 * - Natural-height rule (clip on): a subtle line marking where content
 *   actually ends.
