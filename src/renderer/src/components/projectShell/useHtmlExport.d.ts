 * Exports the whole project as a folder of static HTML + CSS.

 * the store: the export must reflect what's actually saved, and re-reading
 * is both simpler and more truthful than rebuilding source from the live
 * element model.
 *
 * The status is surfaced to the caller rather than only logged. Revealing
 * the folder is not reliable feedback on its own — on Linux `shell.openPath`
 * can no-op with no error — so a success that the user can't see is
 * indistinguishable from a failure they can't see either.
