 *   - On any canvas state change: regenerate code and write the page files
 *     after a debounce, acked by main so chokidar won't re-read our write.
 *   - On `file:changed` for the active page: parse + reload the canvas, but
 *     only if the parsed tree differs from current state.
 *   - On `file:writeAck`: correlate against pending saves and advance the
 *     save-status indicator to "Saved".
 *   - On load: refresh the "last written" cache so the load doesn't write
 *     itself straight back to disk.
 *
 * Pending-write durability: a pending debounced write is flushed against
 * the OUTGOING page's state before a target swap and on `beforeunload`,
 * so an edit made within the debounce window is never silently dropped.
