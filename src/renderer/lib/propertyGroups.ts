 *
 * Deliberate deviation from the backlog spec (which listed
 * Sizing, Layout, and Visibility as togglable groups):
 *   - Sizing off collapses the element to zero / auto, which
 *     reads as "broken" rather than "previewing without these
 *     styles".
 *   - Layout off rearranges every descendant — too much
 *     side-effect for a section toggle.
 *   - Visibility already IS the user-facing surface for
 *     hide/show / opacity. Toggling its section would un-hide a
 *     previously-hidden element, inverting the eye-icon
 *     affordance.
 * Position, Element, and Export aren't togglable for unrelated
 * reasons — they're not CSS-property groups in this sense.
