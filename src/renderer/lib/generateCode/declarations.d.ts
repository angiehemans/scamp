 * absent `opacity` is 1. That does not hold for size: absent `width` is
 * `auto`, which is a different rendering entirely.
 *
 * Skipping it broke two things at once. A rectangle drawn at exactly
 * 100px wide lost its width in the generated CSS, so the canvas showed
 * 100px (from the model) and the browser showed a content-sized box. And
 * it violated the round-trip invariant: `parseCode` reads an absent width
 * as `auto`, not as fixed-at-the-default, so fixed/100 in, auto out.
 *
 * There is no risk of pinning agent-written elements that have no width:
 * those parse as `auto`, and only `fixed` emits a length here.
