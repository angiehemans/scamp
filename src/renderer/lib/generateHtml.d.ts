/**
 * Static HTML export — the model-side sibling of `generateCode`.
 *
 * `generateCode` emits TSX for the running Next project; this emits plain
 * HTML for a self-contained folder the user can open or upload. Both walk
 * the same element model and share `classNameFor` / `tagFor` / `escapeHtml`,
 * so the class names in the markup can't drift from the ones in the CSS.
 *
 * The defining difference is component instances. TSX emits a reference
 * (`<SidebarRow label="home" />`) and lets React resolve it; HTML has no
 * such indirection, so every instance is expanded in place into ordinary
 * elements, with its classes prefixed by the instance id. That prefix is
 * what keeps two instances of one component — and a component root vs. a
 * page root, which are both `.root` — from colliding once the stylesheets
 * are flattened into one document.
 *
 * see docs/plans/html-export-plan.md
