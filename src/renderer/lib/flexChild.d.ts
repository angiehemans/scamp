 * Keeping a box the size it was given inside a flex parent.
 *
 * A flex item's default `flex-shrink: 1` lets the layout squash it below
 * its own `width` as soon as the line overflows. So drawing a 180px box
 * into a 600px row that already holds 260 + 260 of children produced a
 * correct `width: 180px` in the CSS and a 148px box on screen — the
 * stylesheet and the render disagreeing, both behaving exactly as CSS
 * says they should.
 *
 * Scamp's promise is that a fixed size means that size, so a fixed box in
 * a flex parent opts out of shrinking. The guard is the typed `flexShrink`
 * field: it is written to the file (never derived — see the "Rule 2
 * reversal" in docs/plans/flex-sizing-contract-plan.md), it round-trips
 * through `parseCode` like any other declaration, and the Size panel's
 * "Don't shrink" toggle is the same field.
 *
 * see docs/notes/draw-into-flex-parent.md

/**
 * Add the guard when the parent is a flex container.
 *
 * Grid parents are left alone: a grid item is sized by its track and an
 * explicit width is already honoured, so the declaration would be noise.

 * A non-default `flexShrink` is never overwritten — if it is there, either
 * the user or the file it was parsed from meant it.

 *
 * Returns the fields to merge into the size patch, or `{}` when nothing
 * about the guard should change. Only a guard Scamp itself set (`0`) is
