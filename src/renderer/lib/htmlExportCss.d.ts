/**
 * CSS assembly for the HTML export.
 *
 * Every instance of a component gets its own copy of that component's CSS,

 * what makes the export match the canvas: an instance's rules can't be
 * shared with, or overwritten by, another instance's, and the page's own
 * per-instance rule keeps applying on top exactly as it does in the app.
 *
 * The rewriting here is textual, so it's written to survive CSS the
 * generator didn't write — a hand-edited or agent-edited component module
 * can contain descendant selectors, attribute selectors and strings, all of
 * which a "prefix the first token" regex would corrupt.
 *
 * see docs/plans/html-export-plan.md
