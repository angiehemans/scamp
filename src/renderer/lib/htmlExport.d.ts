/**
 * Turns a whole project into the text files of an HTML export.
 *
 * Pure, and deliberately so: it takes the project's source as strings and
 * returns files as strings, leaving every disk operation to the main
 * process. That keeps the part with all the decisions in it — which page
 * links where, which stylesheet an instance's rules land in, how deep a
 * relative path has to climb — testable without Electron or a temp dir.
 *
 * see docs/plans/html-export-plan.md
