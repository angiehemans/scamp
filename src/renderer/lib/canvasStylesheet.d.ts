/**
 * The page's own CSS, injected into the canvas.
 *
 * The canvas has always re-derived styles from the element model into
 * inline styles, which means every property is a chance to translate
 * wrongly — and some CSS has no inline form at all, so it never rendered:
 * `::before` / `::after`, `:nth-child`, and any hand-written selector.
 *
 * Rather than teach the translator more tricks, the canvas now also loads
 * the exact stylesheet the generator writes to disk. Inline styles still
 * win on the properties they set, so this is additive: it supplies only
 * what the translation could never express. Later phases move properties
 * out of the inline layer and let these rules take over.
 *
 * see docs/plans/canvas-preview-parity-plan.md

 * mobile rules fire on a desktop artboard whenever the app window happens
 * to be narrow, and never fire on a mobile artboard in a maximised window.
 *
 * The frame declares `container-type: inline-size`, so the identical
 * conditions evaluated as container queries resolve against the artboard
 * — which is what the preview's viewport means for the design.
 *
 * This is a translation, and worth being honest about that. It is one
 * lossless rewrite of a prelude across the whole sheet, not a re-derivation
 * of each property, and the parity harness checks it at several artboard
 * widths. That is a different kind of risk from the inline translation
 * layer this work exists to remove.
 *
 * Non-width queries are untouched: `prefers-color-scheme` and friends
 * describe the real device and should keep answering for it.
