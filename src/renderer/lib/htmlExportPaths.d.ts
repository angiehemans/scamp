/**
 * Path and link mapping for the HTML export.
 *
 * Scamp page names are a single URL segment (`^[a-z0-9-]+$`, see
 * `shared/pageName.ts`), so the exported tree is at most one level deep:
 *
 *   home   → index.html          + index.css
 *   about  → about/index.html    + about/index.css
 *
 * `about/index.html` rather than `about.html` so a static host serves the
 * page at `/about` — the same route the project used — while the rewritten
 * links still resolve when the folder is opened straight off disk.
 *
 * see docs/plans/html-export-plan.md
