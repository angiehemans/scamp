/**
 * Reduce a captured page to a Scamp element tree.
 *
 * Pure, and the only new idea in the importer: everything either side
 * of it already exists. Capture is a DOM walk; what comes out the far
 * end goes through `generateCode` unchanged. This is the part that has
 * to decide what a page *means* in a model that is far more
 * constrained than a browser's.
 *
 * Three ideas do most of the work:
 *
 * 1. **A computed value is not a decision.** `width: 442.656px` on a
 *    flexing card is the layout's answer, not the author's. Declaring
 *    it freezes the design. Capture drops the obvious cases; this drops
 *    the ones that need the tree to spot.
 * 2. **A DOM is deeper than a design.** Wrapper elements that carry no
 *    visual decision are removed, conservatively — a redundant div is a
 *    smaller problem than a broken layout.
 * 3. **Nothing is dropped silently.** Everything removed or
 *    unrepresentable becomes a finding, because an import that quietly
 *    loses three icons reads as Scamp being broken.
 *
 * The declaration → typed field mapping is NOT reimplemented here: it
 * reuses `makeBaseline` + `applyDeclarations`, the same pair `parseCode`
 * uses, so an imported element and a hand-written one can't disagree.
 * see docs/plans/website-import-plan.md

 * back a design with its punctuation missing. Scamp has no
 * pseudo-elements, but it does have text elements, and a text element
 * is the better answer anyway: you can see it in the layers panel and
 * change it.
 *
 * The host's own words move into a child of their own at the same
 * time, so the order is `[::before, the words, children, ::after]`.
 * Without that the recovered glyph lands after the text it was meant
 * to precede.
 *
 * Runs AFTER `collapse`, so a wrapper is judged on what the page gave
 * it rather than on children this pass invented, and after
 * `resolveInheritance`, which is why each synthesized child is handed
 * the host's inherited typography explicitly here.
