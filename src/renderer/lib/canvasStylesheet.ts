 * `::before` / `::after`, `:nth-child`, and any hand-written selector.
 *
 * Rather than teach the translator more tricks, the canvas now also loads
 * the exact stylesheet the generator writes to disk. Inline styles still
 * win on the properties they set, so this is additive: it supplies only
 * what the translation could never express. Later phases move properties
 * out of the inline layer and let these rules take over.
